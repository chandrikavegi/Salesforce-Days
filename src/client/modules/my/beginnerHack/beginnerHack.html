                We need to help an amusement park manage its rides, shows,
                customers and discounts. Help them by creating a Resort
                application with automated approval processes, using
                configuration only.

                    No code is needed. This includes Apex, Visualforce,
                    Lightning components, custom JavaScript buttons, or
                    integration with external systems.

                    The "Show" object should contain Name, Date, Price, Total
                    Seats and Booked Seats. Each show or ride is limited by
                    number of seats (Total seats).

                <li>
                    The "Ticket" object should capture Customer Name, Number of
                    Adult seats, Number of Child seats and Discount. The Total
                    Price must be derived from the Show object. The Total Cost
                    should be automatically calculated. If the seats are filled,
                    no additional bookings are to be allowed.

                <li>

                        <li>
                            Special discount is permitted through the discount
                            field. If this discount is more than 30%, approval
                            from the manager is required. Record should be
                            locked while under approval process.
