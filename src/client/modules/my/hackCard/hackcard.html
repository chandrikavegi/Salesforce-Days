                We need to help an amusement park manage its rides, shows,
                customers and discounts. Help them by creating a Resort
                application with automated approval processes, using
                configuration only.

                    This challenge is for the Lightning Experience and requires
                    Developer Edition: <a href="sforce.co/2tnM5a7">sforce.co/2tnM5a7</a>.
                </li>

                     No code is allowed. This includes Apex, Visualforce,
                    Lightning components, custom JavaScript buttons, or
                    integration with external systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                     Show object should contain Name, Date, Price, Total Seats
                    and Booked Seats. Each show or ride is limited by number of
                    seats (total seats).
                </li>
                <li>
                     Ticket object should capture Customer Name, Number of
                    Adult seats, Number of Child seats and Discount. Price must
                    be derived from
                    the Show object. The Total Cost should be automatically
                    calculated.
                    If the seats are filled, no additional bookings are to be
                    allowed.
                </li>
                <li>
                     Discounts are permitted for the following scenarios:
                    <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
                        <li>Child seat has a default discount of 25%.</li>
                        <li>
                            Special discount is permitted through the discount
                            field. If this discount is more than 30%, approval from the manager
                            is required. Record should be locked while under
                            approval process.
